# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

If two graphs A and B have the same number of nodes and are completely connnected, they have to be isomorphic. Consider graph a with 3 nodes and graph b with 3 nodes. The definition of isomorphic says that there exists a bijection. Since they have the equivalent amount of nodes, we can match each node to eachother without leaving any nodes out making it one to one. Being that they are completely connected, every node has an edge to every other node, which lets us map every edge in a to b. By the definition of isomorphic, these graphs must be isomorphic.
